An Optimal House Price Prediction Algorithm: XGBoost [@sharma2024optimal]

-   Data: Ames City, Iowa housing data with 2930 records of 82 features
-   Goal: Predict home prices & identify most influential predictors, regression approach
-   Importance: Economic; Consumer spending, borrowing capacity, investments, real estate, lenders
-   Analysis: XGBoost best fit model
    -   Models: "…linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest regression (RF), support vector regressor (SVR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)…" (p. 33)
    -   Metrics: $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$, mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), & cross-validation (CV) metrics
    -   Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) & feature selection used
-   Limitations: 1 dataset, 1 city, unknown reliability, possible infrastructure influence (parks, hospitals, and transportation)

XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System [@chen2016xgboost]

-   Data: Observations, features, purpose:
    -   Allstate, 10M, 4227, insurance claim classification
    -   Higgs Boson, 10M, 28, event classification
    -   Yahoo LTRC, 473K, 700, ranking
    -   Criteo, 1.7B, 67, ad click-through rate
-   Goal: Build end-to-end system featuring weighted quantile sketching, sparsity-aware algorthithm and cache-aware out-of-core tree learning
-   Importance: XGBoost is widely used, effective, open-source, portable, scalable, & resistant to overfitting
-   Analysis: Explained equations; Primarily focusing on advantages of XGBoost for real-world data
-   Limitations: Not highlighted
