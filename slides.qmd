# Introduction

## Literature Review: 

### An Optimal House Price Prediction Algorithm: XGBoost

::: r-fit-text
-   Data: Ames City, Iowa housing data with 2930 records of 82 features
-   Goal: Predict home prices & identify most influential predictors,
    regression approach
-   Importance: Economic; Consumer spending, borrowing capacity,
    investments, real estate, lenders
-   Analysis: XGBoost best fit model
    -   Models: "…linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP),
        random forest regression (RF), support vector regressor (SVR),
        and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)…" (p. 33)
    -   Metrics: $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$, mean squared error (MSE), root
        mean squared error (RMSE), & cross-validation (CV) metrics
    -   Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) & feature selection used
-   Limitations: 1 dataset, 1 city, unknown reliability, possible
    infrastructure influence (parks, hospitals, and transportation)
